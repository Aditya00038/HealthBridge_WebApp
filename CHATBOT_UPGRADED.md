## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### Problem: Still Getting Generic Responses
**Solution:**
1. Check Python server is running: http://localhost:5000/api/health
2. Restart Python server:
   ```powershell
   cd "c:\Project Websites\ES CARECONNECT\careconnect\python-backend"
   python chatbot_api.py
   ```
3. Hard refresh browser: Ctrl + Shift + R

### Problem: "Connection Error"
**Solution:**
1. Verify Python running on port 5000
2. Check terminal for Python errors
3. Ensure CORS is enabled (should be automatic)

### Problem: Responses Are Too Generic
**Solution:**
- This is normal for very vague questions
- Try being more specific
- Ask follow-up questions
- The AI will provide relevant guidance regardless
