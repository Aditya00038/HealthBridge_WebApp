## 🎯 How It Works

### 1️⃣ **Primary AI**: Hugging Face API
```javascript
// Tries to use Microsoft DialoGPT-large (free AI model)
fetch('https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/microsoft/DialoGPT-large')
```

### 2️⃣ **Fallback System**: Intelligent Local Responses
If the API fails or is slow, it automatically falls back to a smart local AI that can handle:
- ✅ Greetings ("Hi", "Hello", "Hey")
- ✅ Programming questions (detects: python, javascript, code, etc.)
- ✅ Science questions (detects: physics, chemistry, biology, quantum, etc.)
- ✅ Medical questions (detects: health, doctor, pain, fever, etc.)
- ✅ Math questions (detects: calculate, equation, algebra, etc.)
- ✅ Writing requests (detects: write, story, poem, essay, etc.)
- ✅ Travel questions (detects: travel, trip, vacation, etc.)
- ✅ Food/cooking (detects: cook, recipe, food, meal, etc.)
- ✅ General knowledge (detects: "what is", "explain", "how does", etc.)
- ✅ Advice requests (detects: "should i", "recommend", "advice", etc.)
- ✅ **ANY OTHER QUESTION** gets a comprehensive fallback response!
